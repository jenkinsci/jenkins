    &lt;textarea> tag on steroids.
    The textarea will be rendered to fit the content. It also gets the resize handle.

    <st:attribute name="field">
      Used for databinding. TBD.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="name">
      This becomes @name of the &lt;textarea> tag.
      If @field is specified, this value is inferred from it.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="value">
      The initial value of the field. This becomes the value of the &lt;textarea> tag.
      If @field is specified, the current property from the "instance" object
      will be set as the initial value automatically,
      which is the recommended approach.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="checkUrl">
      If specified, the value entered in this input field will be checked (via AJAX)
      against this URL, and errors will be rendered under the text field.

      If @field is specified, this will be inferred automatically,
      which is the recommended approach.
