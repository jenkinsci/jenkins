  <st:documentation> <![CDATA[
    Outputs a help link for a <f:form> item if help is available or
    a spacer if none is available.

    The help link is rendered as a table cell with an (?) icon.
    If the user clicks it, the content of the HTML fragment at the given URL 
    is rendered in the area designated as <f:helpArea> by the caller,
    usually in a row beneath the item with help.
    
    The alternative spacer is just an empty table cell.
    
    This tag was introduced to ensure that the space reserved for help items
    is consistent over the UI whether or not help exists.

      URL to the HTML page. Optional. If not given, no help icon is displayed.

      The URL should return a UTF-8 encoded HTML fragment wrapped in a <div> tag.
      The URL is interpreted to be rooted at the context path of Jenkins,
      so it's normally something like "/plugin/foobar/help/abc.html".
