blurb = Jenkins no longer includes the IP address in the CSRF crumb generation and verification. \
  However, the flag <code>hudson.security.csrf.DefaultCrumbIssuer.EXCLUDE_SESSION_ID</code> is set in this controller. \
  As a result, there is currently no part of the CSRF crumb that is unique to a user session. \
  It is strongly recommended to unset this flag, to ensure that CSRF protection remains effective.
