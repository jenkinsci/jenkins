  In this mode, every logged-in user gets full control of Jenkins. The only user
  who won't have full control is anonymous user, who only gets read access.

  <p>
  This mode is useful to force users to log in before taking actions, so that
  you can keep record of who has done what. This setting can be also used in
  public-facing Jenkins, where you only allow trusted users to have user accounts.
