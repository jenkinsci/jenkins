  If you are not using inbound agents, it's recommended that you disable this
  entirely, which is the default installation behavior.
  Jenkins uses a TCP port to communicate with agents connected inbound.
  If you're going to use inbound agents, you can allow the system to randomly
  select a port at launch (this avoids interfering with other programs,
  including other Jenkins instances).
  As it's hard for firewalls to secure a random port, you can instead
  specify a fixed port number and configure your firewall accordingly.
