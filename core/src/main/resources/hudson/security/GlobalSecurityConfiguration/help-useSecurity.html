  <p>
    Enabling security allows configuring authentication (how people can identify themselves) and authorization (what
    permissions they get).
  </p>

  <p>
    A number of options are built in. Please note that granting significant permissions to anonymous users, or allowing
    users to sign up and granting permissions to all authenticated users, does not actually increase security.
