  <p>
    Jenkins shows user-provided descriptions on objects like jobs, views, or
    builds. The markup formatter controls how those descriptions are rendered.
  </p>
  <p>
    &ldquo;Plain text&rdquo; is the default formatter and renders the provided
    description largely as entered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plugins may contribute additional markup formatters that support HTML or
    other markup languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    Some descriptions can be provided from possibly unexpected sources. Some
    examples:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>any user with an account in Jenkins can set their own description</li>
    <li>
      Pipelines, as well as build steps for other job types, may be configured
      to set the current build's description
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Using a markup formatter that renders user input verbatim as HTML may allow
