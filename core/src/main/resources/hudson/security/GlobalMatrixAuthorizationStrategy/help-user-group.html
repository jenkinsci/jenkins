  Note that adding permissions for LDAP groups requires a specific syntax.  In the
  default configuration all LDAP groups must be entered here in all capital letters
  and with "ROLE_" added on the front.  For example, a group called "devs" would be
  entered here as "ROLE_DEVS".  The prefix and case settings may be adjusted by
  editing the <tt>WEB-INF/security/LDAPBindSecurityRealm.groovy</tt> file in your
  Hudson deployment and restarting Hudson.

  <p>
  A special group "authenticated" is also available, which represents all
  authenticated (logged in) users.
