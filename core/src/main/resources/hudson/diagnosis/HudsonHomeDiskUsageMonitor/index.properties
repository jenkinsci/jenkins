blurb=---Translate 22---<code>JENKINS_HOME</code> is almost full
description.1=---Translate 22---\
  Your <code>JENKINS_HOME</code> ({0}) is almost full. \
  When this directory completely fills up, it will wreak havoc because Jenkins cannot store any more data.
description.2=---Translate 22---To prevent that problem, you should act now.
solution.1=---Translate 22---Clean up some files from this partition to make more room.
solution.2=---Translate 22---\
  Move <code>JENKINS_HOME</code> to a bigger partition. \
  See <a href=---Translate 22---"https://www.jenkins.io/redirect/migrate-jenkins-home">our documentation</a> for how to do this.
