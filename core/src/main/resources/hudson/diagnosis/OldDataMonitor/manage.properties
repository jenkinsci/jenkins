  When there are changes in how data is stored on disk, Jenkins uses the following strategy: \
  data is migrated to the new structure when it is loaded, but items/records are not resaved in \
  the new format.  This allows for downgrading Jenkins if necessary.  However, it can also leave \
  data on disk in the old format indefinitely.  The table below lists items/records containing \
  such data, and the Jenkins version(s) where the data structure was changed.
blurb.2=---Translate 26---\
  Sometimes errors occur while reading data (if a plugin adds some data and that plugin is \
  later disabled, if migration code is not written for structure changes, or if Jenkins is \
  downgraded after it has already written data not readable by the older version). \
  These errors are logged, but the unreadable data is then skipped over, allowing Jenkins to \
  start up and function properly.
blurb.3=---Translate 26---\
  The form below may be used to update these items/records to the current format.  Doing so means a \
  downgrade to a Jenkins release or plugin older than the selected version will not be able to \
  read the data stored in the new format.  Note that simply using Jenkins to create and \
  configure jobs and run builds can save data that may not be readable by older Jenkins or \
  plugin versions, even when this form is not used.  Also if any unreadable data errors are \
  reported in the right side of the table above, note that this data will be lost when the \
  item is resaved.
blurb.4=---Translate 26---\
  Eventually the code supporting these data migrations may be removed.  Compatibility will be \
  retained for at least 150 Jenkins releases after the structure change.  Versions older than \
  this are listed above in bold, and it is recommended you resave these items/records.
blurb.5=---Translate 26---\
  (downgrade as far back as the selected version may still be possible)
blurb.6=---Translate 26---\
  It is ok to leave unreadable data in these items/records, as Jenkins will simply ignore it. \
  To avoid the log messages at Jenkins startup you can permanently delete the unreadable data \
  by resaving these items/records using the button below the list.
