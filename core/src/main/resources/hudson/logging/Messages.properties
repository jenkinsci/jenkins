LogRecorderManager.init=---Translate 40---Initializing log recorders
LogRecorderManager.DisplayName=---Translate 40---System Log
LogRecorderManager.LoggerNotFound=---Translate 40---A logger named "{0}" does not exist. \
  Add a logger by this name to a log recorder before attempting to configure its level.
