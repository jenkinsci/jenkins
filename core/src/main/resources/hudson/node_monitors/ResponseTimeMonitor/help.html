<div>
  This monitors the round trip network response time from the controller to the
  agent, and if it goes above a threshold repeatedly, it disconnects the agent.

  <p>
    This is useful for detecting unresponsive agents, or other network problems
    that clog the communication channel. More specifically, the controller sends
    a no-op command to the agent, and checks the time it takes to get back the
    result of this no-op command.
