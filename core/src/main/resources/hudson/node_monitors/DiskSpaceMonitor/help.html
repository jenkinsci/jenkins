<div>
  This monitors the available disk space of
  <code>$JENKINS_HOME</code>
  on the controller or the remote root directory on each agent, and if it gets
  below a threshold, the agent will be marked temporarily offline.

  <p>
    This directory is where all your builds are performed, so if it fills up,
    all the builds will fail.
