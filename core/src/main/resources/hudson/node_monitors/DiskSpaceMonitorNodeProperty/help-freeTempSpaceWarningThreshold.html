  This option configures the amount of minimum amount of free temp space desired
  for the agent's proper operation, such as "1.5GB", "100KiB", etc. If the agent

  shown for it on the computer overview page, but it will not be taken offline.
  <p>Set to 0 to disable this warning on this agent.</p>
