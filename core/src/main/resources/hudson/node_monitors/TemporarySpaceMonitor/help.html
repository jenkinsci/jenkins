  This monitors the available disk space of the temporary directory, and if it
  gets below a certain threshold the agent will be marked temporarily offline.

  <p>
    Java tools and tests/builds often create files in the temporary directory,
    and may not function properly if there's no available space.

  <p>
    More specifically, it checks the available disk space of a partition that
    includes directory designated by the
    <code>java.io.tmpdir</code>
    system property. To check where this directory is on a given agent, go to
    <code>${rootURL}/computer/AGENTNAME/systemInfo</code>
    .
