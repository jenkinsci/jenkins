    This monitors the available disk space of the temporary directory, and if it gets below a certain threshold
    the node will be made offline.

    <p>
    Java tools and tests/builds often create files in the temporary directory, and may not function
    properly if there's no available space.

    <p>
    More specifically, it checks the available disk space of a partition
    that includes directory designated by the <tt>java.io.tmpdir</tt> system property.
    To check where this directory is on a given agent, go to <tt>${rootURL}/computer/SLAVENAME/systemInfo</tt>.
