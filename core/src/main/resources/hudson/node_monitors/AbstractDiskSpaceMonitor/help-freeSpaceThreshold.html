  This option configures the amount of minimum amount of free disk space desired
  for an agent's proper operation, such as "1.5GB", "100KiB", etc. If an agent
  is found to have less free disk space than this amount, it will be marked
  temporarily offline. The threshold can be configured individually for each
  agent via a property.
  <p>
    Set to 0 to disable this check except for agents that configure the
    threshold explicitly.
