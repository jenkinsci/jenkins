  <h2>Accessing Update Sites</h2>
  <p>
    Update center is a collection of update sites. The "main" update site that contains Jenkins update
    can be accessed from <a href="../coreSource/api">here</a>. Otherwise you can obtain update center
    by its ID:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <j:forEach var="site" items="${it.sites}">
      <li>
        <a href="../site/${site.id}/api">${site.id}</a>
      </li>
    </j:forEach>
  </ul>
  <a href="json?tree=sites[id,url]">This data can be retrieved in a form more accessible for programs</a>, too.

  <h2>Update Center Jobs</h2>
  <p>
    Once a plugin installation/update, and core update is requested, these tasks are recorded in the update center
    and get executed in turn. Jenkins calls them "update center jobs". The current list of jobs are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <j:forEach var="j" items="${it.jobs}" varStatus="loop">
      <li>
        <a href="../jobs/${loop.index}/api">${j}</a>
      </li>
    </j:forEach>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each job exposes its own set of APIs.
  </p>
