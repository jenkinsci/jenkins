  Load statistics keep track of four key metrics of resource utilization: \
  <dl> \
    <dt>Number of online executors</dt> \
    <dd>\
      For a computer, if the computer is online then this is the number of executors that \
      the computer has, if the computer is offline then this is zero. \
      For a label, this is the sum of all executors across all online computers in this label. \
      For the entire Jenkins, this is the sum of all executors across all online computers in this Jenkins \
      installation. Other than configuration changes, this value can also change when slaves go offline. \
    </dd> \
    <dt>Number of busy executors</dt> \
    <dd>\
      This line tracks the number of executors (among the executors counted above) \
      that are carrying out builds. The ratio of this to the number of online executors \
      gives you the resource utilization. If all your executors are busy for \
      a prolonged period of time, consider adding more computers to your Jenkins cluster.\
    </dd>\
    <dt>Number of available executors</dt> \
    <dd>\
      This line tracks the number of executors (among the online executors counted above) \
      that are available to carry out builds. The ratio of this to the total number of executors \
      gives you the resource availability. If none of your executors are available for \
      a prolonged period of time, consider adding more computers to your Jenkins cluster.\
    </dd>\
    <dt>Queue length</dt>\
    <dd>\
      This is the number of jobs that are in the build queue, waiting for an \
      available executor (of this computer, of this label, or in this Jenkins, respectively.) \
      This doesn't include jobs that are in the quiet period, nor does it include \
      jobs that are in the queue because earlier builds are still in progress. \
      If this line ever goes above 0, that means your Jenkins will run more builds by \
      adding more computers.\
    </dd>\
  </dl>\
  <p><b>Note:</b>The number of busy executors and the number of available executors need not \
  necessarily be equal to the number of online executors as executors can be suspended from\
  accepting builds and thus be neither busy nor available.</p>\
  <p>The graph is an exponential moving average of periodically collected data values. \
  3 timespans are updated every 10 seconds, 1 minute and 1 hour respectively.</p>
