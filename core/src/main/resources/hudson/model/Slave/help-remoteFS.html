  An agent needs to have a directory dedicated to Jenkins. Specify
  the path to this directory on the agent. It is best to use
  an absolute path, such as <tt>/var/jenkins</tt> or <tt>c:\jenkins</tt>.
  This should be a path local to the agent machine. There is no need for
  this path to be visible from the master.
  <p>
  Agents do not maintain important data; all job configurations, build logs and
  artifacts are stored on the master, so it would be possible to use a temporary
  directory as the agent root directory.
  <br>
  However, by giving an agent a directory that is not deleted after a machine
  reboot, for example, the agent can cache data such as tool installations, or
  build workspaces. This prevents unnecessary downloading of tools, or checking
  out source code again when builds start to run on this agent again after a
  reboot.
  <p>
  If you use a relative path, such as <tt>./jenkins-agent</tt>, the path will be
  relative to the working directory provided by the <i>Launch method</i>.
  <ul>
  <li>For launchers where Jenkins controls starting the agent process, such
  as SSH, the current working directory will typically be consistent,
  e.g. the user's home directory.</li>
  <li>For launchers where Jenkins has no control over starting the agent
  process, such as JNLP when launched from either the command line or via
  a web browser link, the current working directory may change between
  launches of the agent and use of a relative path may prove problematic.
  <br>
  The principal issue encountered when using relative paths with launchers
  like JNLP is the proliferation of stale workspaces and tool installation
  on the agent machine. This can cause disk space issues.</li>
  </ul>
