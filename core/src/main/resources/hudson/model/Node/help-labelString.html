  Labels (AKA tags) are used for grouping multiple slaves into one logical group.

  <p>
  For example, if you have multiple Windows slaves and you have jobs that require
  Windows, then you can configure all your Windows slaves to have the label 'windows',
  then tie the job to the 'windows' label. This allows your job to run on any
  of your Windows slaves but not on anywhere else.
