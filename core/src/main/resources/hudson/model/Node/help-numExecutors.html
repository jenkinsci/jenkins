  The maximum number of concurrent builds that Jenkins may perform on this
  node.
  <p>
  A good value to start with would be the number of CPU cores on the machine.
  Setting a higher value would cause each build to take longer, but could
  increase the overall throughput. For example, one build might be CPU-bound,
  while a second build running at the same time might be I/O-bound &mdash; so
  the second build could take advantage of the spare I/O capacity at that
  moment.
  <p>
  Agents (nodes that are not the master) must have at least one executor.
  To temporarily prevent any builds from being executed on an agent, use the
  <i>Mark this node temporarily offline</i> button on the agent's page.
  <p>
  For the master, set the number of executors to zero to prevent it from
  executing builds locally.
  <i>Note:<i> master will always be able to run flyweight tasks including
  Pipeline's top-level task.
