  <h2>Other Useful URLs</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><a href="../buildNumber">Build number</a></dt>
    <dd>
      This URL returns the build number in <code>text/plain</code> format.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="../buildTimestamp">Build timestamp</a></dt>
    <dd>
      This URL returns the build timestamp. You can also use the <code>format</code> query parameter
      to control the date format, which follows
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">the <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> format pattern</a>.
      (<a href="../buildTimestamp?format=yyyy/MM/dd">example</a>)
      You can also use the <code>Accept-Language</code> HTTP header to control the locale
      in which the date is formatted.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Accessing Progressive Console Output</h2>
  <p>
    You can retrieve in-progress console output by making repeated GET requests with a parameter.
    You'll basically send GET request to
    <a href="../logText/progressiveText?start=0">this URL</a> (or <a href="../logText/progressiveHtml?start=0">this URL</a> if you
    want HTML that can be put into &amp;lt;pre> tag.)
    The <code>start</code> parameter controls the byte offset of where you start.
  </p><p>
    The response will contain a chunk of the console output, as well as the <code>X-Text-Size</code> header that represents
    the bytes offset (of the raw log file).
    This is the number you want to use as the <code>start</code> parameter for the next call.
    The header <code>X-ConsoleAnnotator</code> needs to be copied to the next call in order to resume console annotations.
  </p><p>
    If the response also contains the <code>X-More-Data: true</code> header, the server is indicating that the build
    is in progress, and you need to repeat the request after some delay. The Jenkins UI waits 5 seconds before making
    the next call. When this header is not present, you know that you've retrieved all the data and the build is complete.
  </p><p>
    Streaming/unbuffered variant with <code>multipart/form-data</code> response: Add header <code>Accept: multipart/form-data</code> to enable this mode.
    The response will have two parts: The first part will have <code>Content-Disposition: form-data;name=text</code> and ship the log bytes. The second part will have <code>Content-Disposition: form-data;name=meta</code> and describes the log bytes in a JSON object with the following fields:
    <ul>
      <li><code>completed</code> is the inverse of <code>X-More-Data</code></li>
      <li><code>start</code> is the determined start when using <code>?start=-1000</code> for tailing the last n bytes</li>
      <li><code>end</code> is equivalent to <code>X-Text-Size</code></li>
      <li><code>consoleAnnotator</code> is equivalent to <code>X-ConsoleAnnotator</code></li>
      <li><code>startFromNewLine</code> is set to <code>true</code> when the start was moved to the first new line (e.g. when tailing)</li>
    </ul>
    This streaming mode uses larger disk reads (64kiB instead of 1KiB) and does not normalize line endings to CRLF (previously needed for for Internet Explorer).
    <br />
    The optional parameter <code>?searchNewLineUntil=previousStart</code> can be used when fetching from bytes from the start of the log to search for the first new line in the prior content. Example: Request last 150KiB from a 3MiB file, it might return 3MiB-142KiB ~ 3000000 due to new line detection when tailing. Then request one more MiB with <code>?start=2000000</code> and <code>?searchNewLineUntil=3000000</code>. This will guarantee that the new line detection stops at the start of the last response and does not return from the same "first" new line it can find.
