            When used from the UI, use 303 redirect and send back to the job top page.
            When neither of those options are given, we'll report "201 Created".

            We can't use XHR for submitting this as there might be file parameters,
            and submitting to IFRAME won't work either because 201 can't have HTML response.

            So I think all we can do is this somewhat clunky workaround.
