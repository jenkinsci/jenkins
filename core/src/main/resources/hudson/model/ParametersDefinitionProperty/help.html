  Parameters allow you to prompt users for one or more inputs that will be
  passed into a build.  For example, you might have a project that runs tests on
  demand by allowing users to upload a zip file with binaries to be tested.
  This could be done by adding a <i>File Parameter</i> here.
  <br>
  Or you might have a project that releases some software, and you want users to
  enter release notes that will be uploaded along with the software. This could
  be done by adding a <i>Multi-line String Parameter</i> here.
  <p>
  Each parameter has a <i>Name</i> and some sort of <i>Value</i>, depending on
  the parameter type.  These name-value pairs will be exported as environment
  variables when the build starts, allowing subsequent parts of the build
  configuration (like build steps) to access those values, e.g. by using the
  <tt>${PARAMETER_NAME}</tt> syntax (or <tt>%PARAMETER_NAME%</tt> on Windows).
  <br>
  This also implies that each parameter defined here should have a unique
  <i>Name</i>.
  <p>
  When a project is parameterized, the usual <i>Build Now</i> link will be
  replaced with a <i>Build with Parameters</i> link, where users will be
  prompted to specify values for each of the defined parameters.  If they choose
  not to enter anything, the build will start with the default value for each
  parameter.
  <p>
  If a build is started automatically, for example if started by an SCM trigger,
  the default values for each parameter will be used.
