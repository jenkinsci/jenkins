    If you have multiple views defined in My Views, then the default My Views TabBar becomes too long. The MyViewsTabBar
    Extension Point provides facility for plugins to provide their own implementation of My Views TabBar.
    This DropDown, lists all the available My Views TabBar implementation. Only one TabBar implementation can
    be active at a time for My Views. Select one from the DropDown list.
