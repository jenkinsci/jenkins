  <p>
    When enabled, Jenkins is allowed to remove the
    <b>last successful</b>
    and
    <b>last stable</b>
    build if they match the configured build discarder rules.
  </p>

  <p>
    By default, Jenkins keeps the most recent successful and stable builds, even
    if they are older than the configured retention limits. Enabling this option
    overrides that behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Example:</b>
    <br />
    If builds are configured to be deleted after 7 days, and the most recent
    successful build is 30 days old, it will normally be kept. With this option
    enabled, that build will also be removed.
  </p>

  <p>This option is also available in Pipelines with:</p>

  <pre>
options {
    buildDiscarder logRotator(removeLastBuild: true)
}
  </pre>
</div>
