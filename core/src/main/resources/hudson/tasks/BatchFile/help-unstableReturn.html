    If set, the batch errorlevel result that will be interpreted as an unstable build result.
    If the final errorlevel matches the value, the build results will be set to unstable and
    next steps will be continued. Supported values match the widest errorlevel range for Windows
    like systems. In Windows NT4 and beyond the ERRORLEVEL is stored as a four byte, signed integer,
    yielding maximum and minimum values of 2147483647 and -2147483648, respectively. Older versions
    of Windows use 2 bytes. DOS like systems use single byte, yelding errorlevels between 0-255.
    The value 0 is ignored and does not make the build unstable to keep the default behaviour consistent.
