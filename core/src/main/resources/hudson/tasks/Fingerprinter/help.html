  Jenkins can record the 'fingerprint' of files (most often jar files) to keep track
  of where/when those files are produced and used. When you have inter-dependent
  projects on Jenkins, this allows you to quickly find out answers to questions like:

  <ul>
    <li>
      I want to know where a specific <code>foo.jar</code> came from.
    </li>
    <li>
      I want to know which build of <code>foo.jar</code> is used in BAR build 51.
    </li>
    <li>
      I want to know which build of BAR has the fix in <code>foo.jar</code> build 32.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  To use this feature, all of the involved projects (not just the project
  in which a file is produced, but also the projects in which the file
  is used) need to use this and record fingerprints.
