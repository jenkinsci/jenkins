    Artifact archiver uses Ant <code>org.apache.tools.ant.DirectoryScanner</code> which by default is case sensitive.
    For instance, if the job produces *.hpi files, pattern "**/*.HPI" will fail to find them.<BR/><BR/>
    This option can be used to disable case sensitivity. When it's unchecked, pattern "**/*.HPI" will match any *.hpi files, or pattern "**/cAsEsEnSiTiVe.jar" will match a file called caseSensitive.jar.
