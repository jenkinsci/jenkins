  Archives the build artifacts (for example, distribution zip files or jar files)
  so that they can be downloaded later.
  Archived files will be accessible from the Jenkins webpage.
  <br />
  Normally, Jenkins keeps artifacts for a build as long as a build log itself is kept,
  but if you don't need old artifacts and would rather save disk space, you can do so.

<div>
Note that the Maven job type automatically archives any produced Maven artifacts.
Any artifacts configured here will be archived on top of that.
Automatic artifact archiving can be disabled under the advanced Maven options.
