  Pass all build variables into maven process in form of java properties. This is seldom needed as Jenkins provides it as
  environment variables anyway. Preferred way to access Jenkins build variables is to explicitly map it to property in
  <i>Properties</i> section (<code>MY_VAR=${MY_VAR}</code>).
