WorkspaceSnapshotSCM.NoSuchJob=---Translate 33---No such job ‘{0}’ exists. Perhaps you meant ‘{1}’?
WorkspaceSnapshotSCM.IncorrectJobType=---Translate 33---{0} isn’t a job that has a workspace.
WorkspaceSnapshotSCM.NoBuild=---Translate 33---There’s no qualifying build for the {0} permalink in {1}
WorkspaceSnapshotSCM.NoSuchPermalink=---Translate 33---No such permalink ‘{0}’ exists for {1}
WorkspaceSnapshotSCM.NoWorkspace=---Translate 33---\
  {0} {1} doesn’t have a workspace snapshot attached,\n\
  probably because when the build was done, no other jobs needed its workspace snapshot.\n\
  Please run another build in {0} to get the workspace snapshot taken.
