WorkspaceSnapshotSCM.NoSuchJob=No such job \u2018{0}\u2019 exists. Perhaps you meant \u2018{1}\u2019?
WorkspaceSnapshotSCM.IncorrectJobType={0} isn\u2019t a job that has a workspace.
WorkspaceSnapshotSCM.NoBuild=There\u2019s no qualifying build for the {0} permalink in {1}
WorkspaceSnapshotSCM.NoSuchPermalink=No such permalink \u2018{0}\u2019 exists for {1}
WorkspaceSnapshotSCM.NoWorkspace=\
  {0} {1} doesn\u2019t have a workspace snapshot attached,\n\
  probably because when the build was done, no other jobs needed its workspace snapshot.\n\
  Please run another build in {0} to get the workspace snapshot taken.
