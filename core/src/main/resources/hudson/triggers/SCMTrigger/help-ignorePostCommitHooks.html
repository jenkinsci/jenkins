  Ignore changes notified by SCM post-commit hooks.
<p>
  This can be useful if you want to prevent some long-running jobs (e.g. reports) starting because of every commit, but still want to
  run them periodic if SCM changes have occurred.
<p>
  Note that this option needs to be supported by the SCM plugin, too! The subversion-plugin supports this since version 1.44.
