    API tokens offer a way to make authenticated CLI or REST API calls.
    See <a href="https://jenkins.io/redirect/api-token">our wiki</a> for more details.<br/>
    The username associated with each token is your Jenkins username.<br/>
    <br/>
    Some good practices for keeping your API tokens secure are:
    <ul>
        <li>Use a different token for each application so that if an application is compromised you can revoke its token individually.</li>
        <li>Regenerate the tokens every 6 months (depending on your context). We display an indicator concerning the age of the token.</li>
        <li>Protect it like your password, as it allows other people to access Jenkins as you.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="warning">
        Every time Jenkins is restarted the creation dates for unused legacy tokens are reset
        which means that the dates may be inaccurate.
