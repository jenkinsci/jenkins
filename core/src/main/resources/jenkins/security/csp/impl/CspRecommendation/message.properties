blurb = Jenkins can enforce Content Security Policy (CSP). \
  CSP tells web browsers what they are allowed to do while rendering a web page. \
  This limits or even eliminates the impact of vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS). \
  CSP is disabled by default for backward compatibility, but it is recommended to enable it, if possible.
