<p>
    This list contains all warnings relevant to currently installed components published by the configured update sites.
    These are typically security-related.
    Warnings that have been published but are not relevant to currently installed components (either because the affected component isn't installed, or an unaffected version is installed) are not shown here.
</p>
<p>
    Checked entries (the default) are <em>active</em>, i.e. they're shown to administrators in an administrative monitor.
    Entries can be unchecked to hide them.
    This can be useful if you've evaluated a specific warning and are confident it does not apply to your environment or configuration, and continued use of the specified component does not constitute a security problem.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that only specific warnings can be disabled; it is not possible to disable all warnings about a certain component.
    If you wish to disable the display of warnings entirely, then you can disable the administrative monitor in <em>Configure System</em>.
