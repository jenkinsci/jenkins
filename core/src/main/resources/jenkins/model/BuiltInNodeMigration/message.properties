blurb =---Translate 233--- The word "master" is being retired as the term for the main Jenkins process and the built-in node. \
  The main process is now called "controller" and the built-in node is called just "built-in node". \
  The UI has been updated with these changes. \
  The following features are also affected: \
  <ul>\
    <li>The implicit label of the built-in node changes from <code>master</code> to <code>built-in</code>.</li>\
    <li>The built-in node''s <code>NODE_NAME</code> environment variable also changes from <code>master</code> to <code>built-in</code>.</li>\
  </ul>\
  These changes could affect build behavior, so are not applied automatically. \
  Before you apply these changes, you should do the following: \
  <ul>\
    <li>Review label assignments in job configurations and tool installers for uses of <code>master</code> label. \
        Any such label assignments will not match the built-in node after migration. \
        Besides updating these assignments, you could also explicitly add the <code>master</code> label to the built-in node. \
  </li>\
    <li>Review use of the <code>NODE_NAME</code> environment variable in build scripts.</li>\
  </ul> \
