  When this option is checked, newly triggered builds of this project will be
  added to the queue, but Jenkins will wait for the specified period of time
  before actually starting the build.
  <p>
  For example, if your builds take a long time to execute, you may want to
  prevent multiple source control commits that are made at approximately the
  same time from triggering multiple builds.  Enabling the quiet period would
  prevent a build from being started as soon as Jenkins discovers the first
  commit; this would give the developer the chance to push more commits which
  would be included in the build when it starts.  This reduces the size of the
  queue, meaning that developers would get feedback faster for their series of
  commits, and the load on the Jenkins system would be reduced.
  <p>
  If a new build of this project is triggered while a build is already sitting
  in the queue, waiting for its quiet period to end, the quiet period will not
  be reset.  The newly triggered build will not be added to the queue, unless
  this project is parameterised and the build has different parameters to the
  build already in the queue.
  <p>
  If this option is not checked, then the system-wide default value from the
  <i>Configure System</i> screen will be used.
