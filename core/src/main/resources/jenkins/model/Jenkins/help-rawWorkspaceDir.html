<div>
    Specifies where Jenkins will store workspaces for builds that are executed
    on the master.<br>
    It has no effect on builds that are executed on agents.
    <p>
    This value may include the following variables:
    <ul>
        <li><tt>${JENKINS_HOME}</tt> &mdash; Absolute path of the Jenkins home
            directory
        <li><tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}</tt> &mdash; Absolute path of the directory
            where Jenkins stores the configuration and related metadata for a
            given job
        <li><tt>${ITEM_FULL_NAME}</tt> &mdash; The full name of a given job,
            which may be slash-separated, e.g. <tt>foo/bar</tt> for the job
            <tt>bar</tt> in folder <tt>foo</tt>
    </ul>
    The value should normally include <tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}</tt> or
    <tt>${ITEM_FULL_NAME}</tt>, otherwise different jobs will end up sharing the
    same workspace.
    <p>
    As builds tend to be disk I/O intensive, changing this value enables you to
    put build workspaces on faster storage hardware, such as SSDs or even RAM
    disks.
    <p>
    Any changes to this value will take effect as soon as this configuration
    page is saved, but note that Jenkins will not automatically migrate any data
    from the current workspace root directory.
    <p>
    The default value is <tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}/workspace</tt>.
</div>
