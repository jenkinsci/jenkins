cannotRestart=Jenkins cannot restart itself as currently configured.
description=This will be displayed on most Jenkins pages, you can use it to let users know what is happening. A default message will be added if you don't supply one.
restartWarning=Jenkins will try to pause jobs and restart once all running jobs are either finished or paused. \
  (Pipeline builds may prevent Jenkins from restarting for a short period of time in some cases, but if so, they will be paused at the next available opportunity and then resumed after Jenkins restarts.)
