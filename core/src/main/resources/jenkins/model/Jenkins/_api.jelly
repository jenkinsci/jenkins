  <h2>Build Queue</h2>

    Build queue has <a href="../queue/api/">its own separate API</a>.

    Overall load statistics of Jenkins has <a href="../overallLoad/api/">its own separate API</a>.

  <h2>Restarting Jenkins</h2>
  <p>
    Jenkins will enter into the "quiet down" mode by sending a request to <a href="../quietDown">this URL</a>.
    You can cancel this mode by sending a request to <a href="../cancelQuietDown">this URL</a>. On environments
    where Jenkins can restart itself (such as when Jenkins is installed as a Windows service), POSTing to
    <a href="../restart">this URL</a> will start the restart sequence, or
    <a href="../safeRestart">this URL</a> to restart once no jobs are running.
    All these URLs need the admin privilege to the system.
