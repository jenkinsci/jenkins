    <p>Limit which environment variables are passed to a build step.</p>

    <p>Environment variables passed to the build step are filtered, unless listed below.</p>

    <p>The behavior of this filter depends on whether the environment variable is originally defined outside Jenkins:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the environment variable originates from Jenkins configuration, such as <code>JOB_URL</code>,
            it will not be passed to the build step unless specified here.</li>
        <li>If the environment variable originates from outside Jenkins, such as <code>PATH</code>,
            the behavior depends on the option <em>Process environment variables handling</em>:
            If that option is set to <em>Retain</em>, the original value will be passed to the build step, discarding any modifications inside Jenkins.
            If that option is set to <em>Remove</em>, the variable will not be passed to the build step.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The following table shows the effect of filtering on an environment variable:
