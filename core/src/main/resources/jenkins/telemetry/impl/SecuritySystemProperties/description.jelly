    For many security fixes, the Jenkins security team adds hidden options, sometimes called <em>escape hatches</em>, to disable the security fix.
    This hedges against severe regressions not caught in testing, or unexpected legitimate use cases.
    It is unknown to the team which of these options are actually in use, so this trial collects anonymous information about the values of (typically boolean) security-related Java system properties.
