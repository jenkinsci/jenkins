/**
 * Represents an XML data file that Jenkins uses as a data file.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Evolving data format</h2>
 * <p>
 * Changing data format requires a particular care so that users with
 * the old data format can migrate to the newer data format smoothly.
 *
 * <p>
 * Adding a field is the easiest. When you read an old XML that does
 * not have any data, the newly added field is left to the VM-default
 * value (if you let XStream create the object, such as
 * {@link #read()} &mdash; which is the majority), or to the value initialized by the
 * constructor (if the object is created via {@code new} and then its
 * value filled by XStream, such as {@link #unmarshal(Object)}.)
 *
 * <p>
 * Removing a field requires that you actually leave the field with
 * {@code transient} keyword. When you read the old XML, XStream
 * will set the value to this field. But when the data is saved,
 * the field will no longer will be written back to XML.
 * (It might be possible to tweak XStream so that we can simply
 * remove fields from the class. Any help appreciated.)
 *
 * <p>
 * Changing the data structure is usually a combination of the two
 * above. You'd leave the old data store with {@code transient},
 * and then add the new data. When you are reading the old XML,
 * only the old field will be set. When you are reading the new XML,
 * only the new field will be set. You'll then need to alter the code
 * so that it will be able to correctly handle both situations,
 * and that as soon as you see data in the old field, you'll have to convert
 * that into the new data structure, so that the next {@code save} operation
 * will write the new data (otherwise you'll end up losing the data, because
 * old fields will be never written back.)
 *
 * <p>
 * You may also want to call {@link OldDataMonitor#report(UnmarshallingContext, String)}.
 * This can be done within a nested class {@code ConverterImpl} extending {@link hudson.util.XStream2.PassthruConverter}
 * in an override of {@link hudson.util.XStream2.PassthruConverter#callback}.
 *
 * <p>
 * In some limited cases (specifically when the class is the root object
 * to be read from XML, such as {@link Descriptor}), it is possible
 * to completely and drastically change the data format. See
 * {@link Descriptor#load()} for more about this technique.
 *
 * <p>
 * There's a few other possibilities, such as implementing a custom
 * {@link Converter} for XStream, or {@link XStream#alias(String, Class) registering an alias}.
