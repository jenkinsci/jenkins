/**
 * Marks a field, a method, or a class for automatic discovery, so that Hudson can locate
 * implementations of {@link ExtensionPoint}s automatically.
 *
 * <p>
 * (In contrast, in earlier Hudson, the registration was manual.)
 *
 * <p>
 * In a simplest case, put this on your class, and Hudson will create an instance of it
 * and register it to the appropriate {@link ExtensionList}.
 *
 * <p>
 * If you'd like Hudson to call
 * a factory method instead of a constructor, put this annotation on your static factory
 * method. Hudson will invoke it and if the method returns a non-null instance, it'll be
 * registered. The return type of the method is used to determine which {@link ExtensionList}
 * will get the instance.
 *
 * Finally, you can put this annotation on a static field if the field contains a reference
 * to an instance that you'd like to register.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is the default way of having your implementations auto-registered to Hudson,
 * but Hudson also supports arbitrary DI containers for hosting your implementations.
 * See {@link ExtensionFinder} for more details.
