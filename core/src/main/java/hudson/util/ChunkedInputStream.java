/**
 * <p>Transparently coalesces chunks of a HTTP stream that uses
 * Transfer-Encoding chunked.</p>

 * <p>Note that this class NEVER closes the underlying stream, even when close

 * which allows for the seamless invocation of subsequent HTTP 1.1 calls, while
 * not requiring the client to remember to read the entire contents of the
 * response.</p>
