# About

In a nutshell, Jenkins is the leading open-source automation server.
Built with Java, it provides over 2,000 [plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/) to support automating virtually anything,
so that humans can spend their time doing things machines cannot.

# What to Use Jenkins for and When to Use It

Use Jenkins to automate your development workflow, so you can focus on work that matters most. Jenkins is commonly used for:

- Building projects
- Running tests to detect bugs and other issues as soon as they are introduced
- Static code analysis
- Deployment

Execute repetitive tasks, save time, and optimize your development process with Jenkins.

# Downloads

The Jenkins project provides official distributions as WAR files, Docker images, native packages and installers for platforms including several Linux distributions and Windows.
See the [Downloads](https://www.jenkins.io/download) page for references.

For all distributions Jenkins offers two release lines:

- [Weekly](https://www.jenkins.io/download/weekly/) -
  Frequent releases which include all new features, improvements, and bug fixes.
- [Long-Term Support (LTS)](https://www.jenkins.io/download/lts/) -
  Older release line which gets periodically updated via bug fix backports.
