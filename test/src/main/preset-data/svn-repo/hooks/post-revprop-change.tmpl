# POST-REVPROP-CHANGE HOOK
#
# The post-revprop-change hook is invoked after a revision property
# has been added, modified or deleted.  Subversion runs this hook by
# invoking a program (script, executable, binary, etc.) named
# 'post-revprop-change' (for which this file is a template), with the
# following ordered arguments:
#
#   [1] REPOS-PATH   (the path to this repository)
#   [2] REV          (the revision that was tweaked)
#   [3] USER         (the username of the person tweaking the property)
#   [4] PROPNAME     (the property that was changed)
#   [5] ACTION       (the property was 'A'dded, 'M'odified, or 'D'eleted)
#
#   [STDIN] PROPVAL  ** the old property value is passed via STDIN.
#
# Because the propchange has already completed and cannot be undone,
# the exit code of the hook program is ignored.  The hook program
# can use the 'svnlook' utility to help it examine the
# new property value.
#
# On a Unix system, the normal procedure is to have 'post-revprop-change'
# invoke other programs to do the real work, though it may do the
# work itself too.
#
# Note that 'post-revprop-change' must be executable by the user(s) who will
# invoke it (typically the user httpd runs as), and that user must
# have filesystem-level permission to access the repository.
#
# On a Windows system, you should name the hook program
# 'post-revprop-change.bat' or 'post-revprop-change.exe',
# but the basic idea is the same.
# 
# The hook program typically does not inherit the environment of
# its parent process.  For example, a common problem is for the
# PATH environment variable to not be set to its usual value, so
# that subprograms fail to launch unless invoked via absolute path.
# If you're having unexpected problems with a hook program, the
# culprit may be unusual (or missing) environment variables.
# 
# Here is an example hook script, for a Unix /bin/sh interpreter.
# For more examples and pre-written hooks, see those in
# the Subversion repository at
# http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/tools/hook-scripts/ and
# http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/contrib/hook-scripts/
