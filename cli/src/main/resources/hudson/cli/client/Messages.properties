  Usage: java -jar jenkins-cli.jar [-s URL] command [opts...] args...\n\
  Options:\n\
  \ -s URL              : the server URL (defaults to the JENKINS_URL env var)\n\
  \ -webSocket          : connect using WebSocket (the default; works well with most reverse proxies; requires Jetty)\n\
  \ -http               : use a pair of HTTP(S) connections rather than WebSocket\n\
  \ -ssh                : use SSH protocol rather than WebSocket (requires -user; SSH port must be open on server)\n\
  \ -i KEY              : SSH private key file used for authentication (for use with -ssh)\n\
  \ -noCertificateCheck : bypass HTTPS certificate check entirely. Use with caution\n\
  \ -noKeyAuth          : do not try to load the SSH authentication private key. Conflicts with -i\n\
  \ -user               : specify user (for use with -ssh; must have registered a public key)\n\
  \ -strictHostKey      : request strict host key checking (for use with -ssh)\n\
  \ -logger FINE        : enable detailed logging from the client\n\
  \ -auth [ USER:SECRET | @FILE ] : specify username and either password or API token (or load from them both from a file);\n\
  \                                 for use with -http.\n\
  \                                 Passing credentials by file is recommended.\n\
  \                                 See https://www.jenkins.io/redirect/cli-http-connection-mode for more info and options.\n\
  \ -bearer [ TOKEN | @FILE ]     : specify authentication using a bearer token (or load the token from file);\n\
  \                                 for use with -http. Mutually exclusive with -auth.\n\
  \                                 Passing credentials by file is recommended.\n\
