  Sun One Java Application Server and Glassfish (as of 2007/4) makes
  old Ant classes visible to the web application classloader, and
  that causes https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-458

  So change the delegation order to make sure we pick up Ant from
  Hudson. See http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-2634/6n4tl5kp3?a=view#abxhy
