There are two known issues with YAHOO.widget.Overlay (and its subclasses) that 
manifest in Gecko-based browsers on Mac OS X:

    1) Elements with scrollbars will poke through Overlay instances floating 
       above them.
    
    2) An Overlay's scrollbars and the scrollbars of its child nodes remain  
       visible when the Overlay is hidden.

To fix these bugs:

    1) The "overflow" property of an Overlay instance's root element and child 
       nodes is toggled between "hidden" and "auto" (through the application  
       and removal of the "hide-scrollbars" and "show-scrollbars" CSS classes)
       as its "visibility" configuration property is toggled between 
       "false" and "true."
    
    2) The "display" property of <SELECT> elements that are child nodes of the 
       Overlay instance's root element is set to "none" when it is hidden.

PLEASE NOTE:  
  
    1) The "hide-scrollbars" and "show-scrollbars" CSS classes classes are 
       applied only for Gecko on Mac OS X and are added/removed to/from the 
       Overlay's root HTML element (DIV) via the "hideMacGeckoScrollbars" and 
       "showMacGeckoScrollbars" methods of YAHOO.widget.Overlay.
    
    2) There may be instances where the CSS for a web page or application 
       contains style rules whose specificity override the rules implemented by 
       the Container CSS files to fix this bug.  In such cases, is necessary to 
       leverage the provided "hide-scrollbars" and "show-scrollbars" classes to 
       write custom style rules to guard against this bug.
