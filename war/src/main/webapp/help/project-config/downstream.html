    Trigger builds of the other projects once a build is successfully completed.
    Multiple projects can be specified by using comma, like "abc, def".

    <p>
        Other than the obvious use case where you'd like to build other projects that have a dependency
        on the current project, this can also be useful to split a long build process in to multiple
        stages (such as the build portion and the test portion).

        A project located inside an ItemGroup need to be specified by using a path. It can be an absolute
        path starting from Jenkins root, like "/grp/abc" where "grp" is an ItemGroup located at the root
        of Jenkins. It can also be a relative path from the current project location, like "grp/abc" where
        "grp" is an ItemGroup located at the same level as the current project.
        Examples of plugins that provide an ItemGroup implementation include but are not limited to the
