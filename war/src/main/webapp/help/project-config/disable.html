<div>
  Sometimes you want to temporarily stop building a project. For example,
  maybe you are in the middle of a large migration and you know new builds are
  going to fail. Or maybe a project is built every hour but you know that the
  CVS server will be down for the next 24 hours.

  <p>
  When this option is set, no new build is performed on this project. This
  allows you to disable new builds without changing any of the build dependency
  chain or changing the notification set up.
