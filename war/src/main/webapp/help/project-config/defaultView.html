<div>
  If you have multiple views defined, you can choose the one to be used as the
  Jenkins top page. This is useful for larger Jenkins deployments where the
  'All' view is too long to be a practical view. (Choosing another view as the
  default allows you to delete the 'All' view, if so desired.)
