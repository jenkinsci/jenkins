<div>
  Accepts a file submission from a browser as a build parameter. The uploaded
  file will be placed at the specified location in the workspace, which your
  build can then access and use.
  <p>This is useful for many situations, such as:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Letting people run tests on the artifacts they built.</li>
    <li>
      Automating the upload/release/deployment process by allowing the user to
      place the file.
    </li>
    <li>Perform data processing by uploading a dataset.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The name of the submitted file is available in the environment variable
    whose name is the same as file location. For example, if you set the file
    location to be
    <code>abc.zip</code>
    , then
    <code>${abc.zip}</code>
    would give you the original file name passed from the browser (such as
    <code>my.zip</code>
    .) The name will not include the directory name portion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that some shells, such as dash, or /bin/sh provided by dash, do
    not make such environment variables with special characters available to
    child processes. Try using shebang like
    <code>#!/bin/bash</code>
    in shell script and use
    <code>$(printenv abc.zip)</code>
    to get the original file name.
  </p>
  <p>
    File upload is optional. If a user chooses not to upload anything, Jenkins
    will simply skips this parameter and will not place anything (but it also
    will not delete anything that's already in the workspace.)
  </p>
  <p>
    From the CLI, the
    <code>-p</code>
    option to the
    <code>build</code>
    command should take an empty value to read from standard input. (Only one
    file parameter can be defined this way.)
  </p>
