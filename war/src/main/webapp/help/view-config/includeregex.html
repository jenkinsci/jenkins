<div>
  If configured, the regular expression will be applied to all job names. Those
  that match the regular expression will be shown in this view. Tip: to
  <em>exclude</em>
  certain patterns, use negative lookahead. For example, to display all jobs not
  named
  <samp>
    test
    <i>something</i>
  </samp>
  , use:
  <samp>(?!test.*).*</samp>
</div>
