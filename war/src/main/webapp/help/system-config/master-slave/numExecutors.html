  This controls the number of concurrent builds that Jenkins can perform on this slave.
  So the value affects the overall system load Jenkins may incur.
  A good value to start with would be the number of processors.

  <p>
  Increasing this value beyond that would cause each build to take longer, but it could increase
  the overall throughput, because it allows CPU to build one project while another build is waiting
  for I/O.

  <p>
  Setting this value to 0 is useful to remove a disabled slave from Jenkins temporarily without
  losing other configuration information.
