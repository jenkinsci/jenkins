  Controls how Jenkins schedules builds on this machine.

  <dl>
    <dt><b>
      Utilize this slave as much as possible
    </b></dt>
    <dd>
      This is the default and normal setting.
      In this mode, Jenkins uses this slave freely. Whenever there is a build
      that can be done by using this slave, Jenkins will use it.
    </dd>

    <dt><b>
      Leave this machine for tied jobs only
    </b></dt>
    <dd>
      In this mode, Jenkins will only build a project on this machine when
      that project specifically has this slave as the "assigned node".

      This allows a slave to be reserved for certain kinds of jobs.
      For example, to run performance tests continuously from Jenkins,
      you can use this setting with # of executors as 1, so that only one performance
      test runs at any given time, and that one executor won't be blocked
      by other builds that can be done on other slaves.
