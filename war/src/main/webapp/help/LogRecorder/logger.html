<div>
    Specify a set of logger names and the corresponding log levels that
    this log recorder will collect. For example, if you specify
    <tt>jenkins.model</tt> and <tt>INFO</tt> then any events triggered
    for <tt>jenkins.model</tt> or its descendents (e.g.
    <tt>jenkins.model.Jenkins</tt>) with the log level INFO or above will
    show up in this log recorder.

    <p>
    If you have multiple entries, a log message will only be recorded if
    the most specific matching logger's level would collect it.
