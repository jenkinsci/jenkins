<div>
  Specify a local directory (relative to <a href="./ws">the workspace root</a>)
  where this module is checked out. If left empty, the last path component of the URL
  is used as the default, just like the <tt>svn</tt> CLI.
  A single period (<code>.</code>) may be used to check out the project directly
  into the workspace rather than into a subdirectory.
</div>
