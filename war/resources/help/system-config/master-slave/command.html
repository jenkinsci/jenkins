  Command to be used to launch a slave agent program, which controls the slave
  computer and communicates with the master.

  <h3>JNLP slave agents</h3>
  <p>
  Leave this field empty if you'd like to launch slave agents via JNLP.
  With this setting, the slave information page (hudson/computer/***/) will
  have a JNLP launch icon, and you can click that link from the correct slave
  machine to launch a slave agent via JNLP.
  <p>
  This mode is convenient for Windows slaves that often do not have a remote execution
  mechanism.

  <h3>ssh/rsh slave agents</h3>
  <p>
  When an actual command is specified in this field,
  this command is executed on the
  master, and Hudson assumes that the executed program launches the <tt>slave.jar</tt>
  program on the correct slave machine.


  <p>
  A copy of <tt>slave.jar</tt> can be found in <tt>WEB-INF/slave.jar</tt> inside
  <tt>hudson.war</tt>.

  <p>
  In a simple case, this could be
  something like "ssh <i>hostname</i> java -jar ~/bin/slave.jar".

  However, it is often a good idea to write a small shell script, like the following, on a slave
  so that you can control the location of Java and/or slave.jar, as well as set up any
  environment variables specific to this slave node, such as PATH.
  
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
exec java -jar ~/bin/slave.jar
</pre>

  <p>
  You can use any command to run a process on the slave machine, such as RSH,
  as long as stdin/stdout of this process will be connected to
  "java -jar ~/bin/slave.jar" eventually.

  <p>
  In a larger deployment, It is also worth considering to load <tt>slave.jar</tt> from
  a NFS-mounted common location, so that you don't have to update this file every time
  you update Hudson.

  <p>
  Setting this to "ssh -v <i>hostname</i>" may be useful for debugging connectivity
  issue.
